# Predicting Heart malfunctioning with ECG signals

## Objective
Find a machine learning model that can predict with the best accuracy possible if a patient has some different arrhythmias or myocardial infarction, based on his or her ECG.

This analysis used the dataset compiled by kaggle [link](https://www.kaggle.com/shayanfazeli/heartbeat), based on the data published by physionet.org [here](https://www.physionet.org/content/ptbdb/1.0.0/). Please see the citations below.

The following models were evaluated:
1. Gradient Boosted Machine (GBM)
2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with 3 conv layers and 2 fully connected layers
3. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with 4 conv layers and 2 fully connected layers

Several hyperparameters tested, and the configuration that produced the best accuracy was:

- CNN with 4 conv layers and 2 FC layers
- batch size = 128
- epochs = 250
- Please see the code, file ptb_cnn_0990.ipynb for details on the other hyperparameters used.
